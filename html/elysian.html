			<h1>elysian</h1>
			<p>
			elysian is a social media app that also has a form of marketplace platform that is based on visual arts,
			such as digital and traditional arts, 3D art, photography and other.
			</p>
			<img src="../img/elysian/elysian.png" alt="elysian Social Media App">
			<h3>Problem</h3>
			<p>
				Visual artist need a platform where they can find all in one - a place for finding inspiration,
				as well the place where they can earn money in a simple and convenient way.
			</p>
			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<p>
				elysian is a social media for anyone, that helps artists all around the world find other artists who share the same or similar passions.
				The form of social media allows artists to interact with one another, but it also gives them an opportunity to sell their work
				and service for set price by opening their stores and organizing their commission tables.
			</p>
			<h3>My part:</h3>
			<p>
				I’ve always loved to draw, so I’ve always wanted to see artists have a platform that can serve them as a social media
				and a place where they can create their own business while easily managing the two.
			</p>
			<h4>Mobile Application</h4>
			<p>
				When logged on, the user sees their “feed page” with all of their followings, and next to it an “explore page”
				where they can search for art and artists by name or tags. The user has several options:<br>
				Make a new post – public post.<br>
				Set a commission table – table with prices.<br>
				Open a shop – post set of images of the product or service you are selling, as well the prices for it.<br>
				<br>
				wireframe, figma, prototype
			</p>
			<h4>Web Application</h4>
			<p>
				User has the option to log into his Elysian account and browse his followings just like on his mobile device,
				however the web version also enables the user the “open gallery mode” in which the user can browse the artists’
				public posts even if not logged in on the app. Options to leave a comment, like or message the artists, can be done only after a log in.
