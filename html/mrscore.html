			<h1>MrScore</h1>
			<p>
				MrScore is a desktop/mobile app that helps teachers track students’ progress.
			</p>
			<img src="../img/mrscore/mrscore.png" alt="MrScore">
			<h3>Problem</h3>
			<p>
				Teachers, especially elderly, often find it difficult to keep track of all their classes and students.
				Having most of the lessons now being digitalized, it can be difficult for some of the teachers to keep up
				with all the websites, next to their papers and documents.
			</p>
			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<p>
				MrScore would help teachers and professors all around the world with keeping track of all their students’ attendance, missions and scores.
				It also provides them with their personal schedule and notes, allowing them to have all their necessary school documents in one place.
			</p>
			<h3>My part:</h3>
			<p>
				As a student, for practice, I’d kept records my classmates’ and my scores in Excel sheet.
				As we had several elderly professors, most of the time they would take a lot of time from their class just finding the papers
				with list of students’ names so they can take their attendance or noting their grades and points.
			</p>

			<p>
				Consulting with two of my professors, I’ve noted their insights on the matter. For them, that would include the ability to send e-mails to students,
				notifying them of their received grade. As mentioned, eldery, just as adult teachers would prefer to protected their eyes straining from the screen –
				hence they’d wish for the option to change theme, from light to dark.

			<h3>Additional</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Having all things at one place is already a huge assessment to the school organization, however there is loads of documentations,
					school’s presentations and lessons that could be imported for easier access.
				</li>
				<li>
					The application could be modified for students purposes as well. It can serve as a read only application.
					It would print out received scores, and final grades given and signed by the teacher which then would be sent to the students via e-mail.
				</li>
				<li>
					Furthermore, for high schoolers, the app could be more oriented towards students, regarding given information about colleges they could apply to
					(their requirements, rules, school system etc.).
				</li>
				<li>
					Teachers could also provide brief courses on basic topics (e.g. writing e-mails, how to make a payment).
				</li>
				<li>
					MrScore could expand to being more than just a score tracker, whilst serving its main purpose,
					it can also help principals when selecting students to enroll to their school, or helping teachers
					when choosing students for certain extracurricular activities.
				</li>
