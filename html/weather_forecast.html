			<h1>Weather Forecast</h1>
			<p>
				Weather Forecast is an app with clean and simple UI, which shows current temperature anywhere in the world, 12 hours in ahead, and 7 days in advance.
				It gives options of changing the unit (Celsius and Fahrenheit), as well as the language (Serbian and English).
			</p>

			<h3>My part:</h3>
			<p>
				The project was created by my friend who did the back-end part, and myself, who did the front-end of the app.<br>
				My part included creating the visual concept of the app (according to the given data we extracted from the API),
				placing the elements (where the settings page would be, how will the elements in the list be organized), and then
				implementing all of that trough XML code.<br>
				I’ve found suitable icons, chose appropriate colors and fonts for the app. I also created shapes used as containers
				for certain elements that need to be grouped, and edited default transition between the activities in the app, to a slider transition.
			</p>
			<h3>XML</h3>
			<p>
				In order to remove unnecessary details on the screen, I’ve decided to use theme with noActionBar, so that the screen will have more
				space to showcase the important information. At the early versions of the app, I’ve started with combinations of LinearLayout and
				RelativeLayout, however, after many tests, I’ve noticed that Constraintlayout works much better with the application’s responsivity.
				I’ve converted all the activities’ layouts to ConstraintLayout which served as the container for all the other elements, such as:
				ListView, Button, ImageButton, ImageView, EditText and TextView, and Switch.
			</p>

			<p>
				When downloading the app the first time, user sees settings page first where he needs to input the location. Every other time,
				the user is greeted with the splash screen with the app name and the logo. The main screen, in the center, shows current temperature,
				followed by the appropriate icon, percentage of clouds and humidity. Below it, there is a list showing the temperature in the next 12 hours.
				In the center of the header, the date is set with the chosen location below it. On the top right on the header, settings icon is placed, and
				top left calendar icon that opens a new activity, 7 Days which shows a list of temperature in the upcoming seven days.
				Settings page lets the user change its location, unit or language.
